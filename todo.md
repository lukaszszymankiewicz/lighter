i- [x] add pre-calculated values to tiles while level creation
- [x] add pre-calculated values to entity while level creation
- [x] all assets needs to have one functio to load them and fill the library (LIB_create_entity_library())
- [x] entity needs a blueprint which holds all data
- [x] wobble needs a blueprint which holds all data
- [x] shorten the generate method
- [x] lightsource needs a blueprint which holds all data
- [x] textures to data
- [x] delete assets.h and files. (?)
- [x] textures should use blueprint
- [x] move level to data
- [x] validate if everything were read to library correctly
- [x] store levels on c file (like others)
- [x] store tilesets on c files (like others)
- [x] store tiles on c fles (like others)
- [x] add library tests to check whether the files are read correctly
- [x] add option to run game without making window and graphic
- [x] test to run game (without graphic!)
- [x] add some struct to hold things to be draw (rather than using GFX function
  in entity and level wtc).
- [x] get rid of primitvies, please!
- [x] add entity rendering in OpenGL
- [x] clear all imports
- [x] check if collision is working
- [x] check why failing down has not lowering the velocity to 0
- [x] check why the jumping is not working!
- [x] check why the holding item seems to lost its position for some frames
- [x] check if animation is working
- [x] code for normal->gl coords should be in some util module
- [x] delete all print statements
- [x] add error codes in all gfx initialization
- [x] reading GFX (video, window) to the library module
- [x] add light shader
  - [x] made shader readable from file
  - [x] made one polygon shader with white color
  - [x] made multi-polygon shader
  - [x] made multi-source shader
  - [x] add color to light shader
  - [x] make texture a typical openGl shader for consistency
  - [x] camera projection to shader!
    - [x] make one draw call to draw tiles
  - [x] add camera uniforma to entity rendering
  - [x] sprites to separate shader
  - [x] VAO and VBO to shader program struct
  - [x] use proper uniform function where needed
  - [x] clean up gl util module, use atomizd function (rename camera functions to someting)
  - [x] remove this ugly render coord from entity blueprints
  - [x] try to join two render functions
  - [x] remove global scale, use ortho matrix instead
  - [x] some kind of global camera/scale matrix/vector?
  - [x] remove camera uniforms, use projection matrix instead
  - [x] framebuffer for each layer (maybe, scalling can be omitted then?)
  - [x] add global scale can be propably easily deleted
  - [x] put shader light effect to buffer
  - [x] made shader pixel-perfect
  - [x] scale framebuffer for pixel perfect graphic
  - [x] add entity filp
  - [x] add transparency to light effect shader (test it)
  - [x] put camera ideally on center of screen
  - [x] multiple light polygons 
  - [x] add differ effect
  - [x] add proper scene cleaning
  - [ ] add wobble
  - [ ] tiles disseaperad
  - [ ] remove all unnecessary prints
- [ ] delete unit all unit-tests
- [x] clear all memory leaks!
- [x] repair light vertex calculations
- [x] remove error codes
- [x] make tile render as as separate shader
- [x] game options to some global config

UTIL:
 - [ ] add string name to each entity (to ease the debugging!)
 - [ ] create a namesystem for ids: gl_texture ids should be reconizable from library ids
 - [ ] consistent types - use float everywhere
 - [ ] check for unused constants/functions
 - [ ] cleanup Makefile
 - [ ] point/geometry etc to some 'core' module
 - [x] rethink which of the engine compononests should be an extern
   (entity_manager?)
 - [ ] add naming convention to shaders
 - [ ] GFX modules to gfx_manager (?)

DEBUG:
 - [ ] entities tend to disappear when above some short range
