Lighter

Custom rougelike game engine (and maybe full game later on).


Features to be implemented:
 - 2D game enginge,
 - simple raycasting engine (dynamic light),

How to start developing:

1) Linux:
 - install make
 - install gcc
 - install SDL2 (neat installation guide can be found here: https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php),

2) Windows:
 - All you need to know (and set) is in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmGBhM8AEj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmGBhM8AEj8

You can start developing!


 How to run:
 - compile using make command:
```
make lighter
```
 - run game by using command: 
```
./lighter,
```

On Visual Studio Code use default compile & run options.


How to use prototype scripts:

Prototype scripts are for testing only, and it is not required (at all) to run any of the game code.
Here lays some mathematical concepts for further implementation/checking etc.

 - ensure you have Python3.5+ on your system,
 - create virtual enviroment in main folder of this project:
```
python3.8 -m venv venv
```
 - activate virtual enviroment,
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
 - install required packages:
```
pip install -r proto.req.txt
```
Now you can run all prototype scripts!
