Shadowcasting + rudimental 2D game engine Proof of Concept.

Written in C, with a little help of OpenGL and SDL library.

Code is pretty much a mess - this is a result of treating it as a playground to
learn new programming language as well as new algorithms. The fact that I barely
remember that I have such project did not helped at all

There is so much things in here, which I would code better or just dump because
it is trash, but sometimes it is better to let it go rather than push it up to
limits. There are few memory leaks here and there, few things which are just
dumb, but yeah, it is what it is.

I'll propably strip this code to be use as a more robust implementation of 2D
sidescroller.
