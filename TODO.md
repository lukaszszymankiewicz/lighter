 TIER 1:

 BORING THINGS:
 - [ ] investigate changing level size,

 - [ ] Investigate segfaults after compiling (events handling propably),
 - [ ] Add some "check if falling condition",
 - [ ] Invent come system for hitting keaboard (block spamming keys, detect longer pressing etc.).

 COOL THINGS:
 - [ ] wobble should be stronger in air jumping,
 - [ ] add jumping/falling animation,
 - [ ] add light on the vertex of the lighted wall,

 VERY HARD THINGS:
 - [ ] try implement OpenGL shade for light effect.

TIER 2:
 - [ ] GUI level editor,
 - [ ] sprite/animation/light/hitbox GUI editor,
 - [ ] prepare something what will make stand-alone distribution of game for linux,
 - [ ] prepare something what will make stand-alone distribution of game for Windows.
 - [ ] Hero/Object/light should strore its data in separate file rather than headers,
