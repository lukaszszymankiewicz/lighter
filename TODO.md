 DONE:
 - [x] add hero movement
 - [x] add walls
 - [x] rays collission with walls
 - [x] fill light! (and obstacles polygons if that matters!)
 - [x] make sure that point is always expressed in integer numbers (not floats!)
 - [x] fill full polygon, not set of triangles
 - [x] cut code into segments (light/primitives/shared structs etc)
 - [x] add new lightsource (lighter)
 - [x] add alpha lighting (offset rays should make not fully light)
 - [x] add alpha lighting (for lighter light source)
 - [x] get rid of strange artifacts while endering texture (propably another another texture will do
   the trick)
 
 BORING THINGS:
 - [ ] document the code
 - [ ] add tests (finish it)

 COOL THINGS:
 - [ ] lighter in the hand of ther should shake a little bit (up and down) in slowly matter to look more
   realistic
 - [ ] add some frame limit, as now game use 100% of the CPU.
 - [ ] gravity
 - [ ] any of the more sofistaced controls and movements of a hero
 - [ ] scrolling
 - [ ] full-screen window
 - [ ] graphic should scale up to full window
 - [ ] any of the grpahics of a hero
 - [ ] any of the grpahics of level
