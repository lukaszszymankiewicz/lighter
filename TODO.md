 TIER 1:

 BORING THINGS:
 - [ ] refactor Makefile (compile each file at once),
 - [ ] add Makefile sections for Windows,
 - [ ] window graphics scaling,
 - [ ] Hero/Object/light should strore its data in separate file rather than headers,
 - [ ] Investigate segfaults after compiling (events handling propably),
 - [ ] Invent come system for hitting keaboard (block spamming keys, detect longer pressing etc.).
 - [ ] Put SDL library directly into game files

 COOL THINGS:
 - [ ] wobble should be stronger in air jumping
 - [ ] add light on the vertex of the lighted wall,
 - [ ] implement radius of the light effect,
 - [ ] implement framebuffer for light effect,

 MILESTONES:
 - [ ] GUI level editor,
 - [ ] sprite/animation/light/hitbox GUI editor
 - [ ] prepare something what will make stand-alone distribution of game for linux,
 - [ ] prepare something what will make stand-alone distribution of game for Windows.

 VERY HARD THINGS:
 - [ ] try implement OpenGL shade for light effect (it is possible but require some research and
   learning).

TIER 2:

- [ ] dunno
